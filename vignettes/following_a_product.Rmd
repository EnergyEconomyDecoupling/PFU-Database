## Introduction

It can be helpful to follow a product
through the energy conversion chain (ECC) 
in the CL-PFU database 
to trace its production and consumption. 
Doing so enables comparison to raw data 
to enhance understanding of the way the PSUT framework represents IEA data.

To provide an example, 
this vignette follows one product (Naphtha) through the USA
in 2013 and 2014. 
Comparison between the two years demonstrates 
an interesting feature of the CL-PFU database.


## Evaluate a single year

To work with the CL-PFU database in the vignette, 
be sure you have access to several packages.


```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(matsbyname)
library(pins)
```

The `matsbyname` package is especially useful
for isolating a particular product in an energy conversion chain.

To load data for 2013 and 2014 from the CL-PFU Database, 
one can use the following code:

```{r}
pinboard <- pins::board_folder("~/Dropbox/Fellowship 1960-2015 PFU database/OutputData/PipelineReleases")
df <- pinboard %>%
  # Load USA data from v0.9 of the database
  pins::pin_read(name = "psut_usa", version = "20230220T223535Z-35e3e") %>% 
  # Isolate data of interest
  dplyr::filter(Year %in% c(2013, 2014), 
                Energy.type == "E",
                Last.stage == "Final", 
                IEAMW == "IEA")
dplyr::glimpse(df)
```


## Interrogate PSUT matrices

Next, we interrogate the PSUT matrices 
(**R**, **Y**, **V**, and **Y**) for Naphtha. 
(Note that row 1 contains 2013 data and row 2 contains 2014 data.) 
Along the way, we will compare to the original
IEA World Extended Energy Balance (WEEB) data. 
We begin with 2013 data.

The **R** matrix contains 
exogenous inputs of Naphtha to the ECC.
In 2013, there are both "Imports" and releases from stock ("Stock changes") of Naphtha.

```{r}
R_supply_2013 <- df$R[[1]] %>% 
  matsbyname::select_rows_byname("Naphtha") %>%
  matsbyname::clean_byname()
R_supply_2013
```

The IEA data show the same information.

![Naptha Imports shown in IEA Extended World Energy Balance data.](./figure/Naptha_imports.png)

![Naptha Stock changes shown in IEA Extended World Energy Balance data.](./figure/Naptha_stock_changes.png)

However, there is no use (**U**) of Naphtha by the energy industry in 2013.

```{r}
U_consumption_2013 <- df$U[[1]] %>% 
  matsbyname::select_rows_byname("Naphtha") %>%
  matsbyname::clean_byname()
U_consumption_2013
```

The IEA EWEB data show the same.

![Naptha Energy industry own use shown in IEA Extended World Energy Balance data.](./figure/Naptha_EIOU.png)

(1 ktoe of Naphtha is used in 2014, as we will see later.)

Oil refineries make (**V**) Naphtha.

```{r}
V_supply_2013 <- df$V[[1]] %>% 
  matsbyname::select_cols_byname("Naphtha") %>%
  matsbyname::clean_byname()
V_supply_2013
```

The product of Naphtha found in the **V** matrix 
comes from the "Oil refineries" row in the IEA's EWEB data.

![Naptha manufacturing by Oil refineries as shown in IEA Extended World Energy Balance data.](./figure/Naptha_make.png)

Naphtha is consumed in final demand (**Y**) for Non-energy use industry/transformation/energy.

```{r}
Y_consumption_2013 <- df$Y[[1]] %>% 
  matsbyname::select_rows_byname("Naphtha") %>%
  matsbyname::clean_byname()
Y_consumption_2013
```

Again, the consumption of Naphtha for non-energy uses is evident in the IEA's EWEB data.

## Verify overall energy balance

We can see that Naphtha is balanced, as expected, 
for 2013.
In fact, energy balance is verified for all products 
in the CL-PFU database at the time of construction. 
Small corrections are made, 
if necessary (< 5 ktoe) and placed in the "Statistical differences" category. 
Thus, energy balance is guaranteed for every energy carrier in the CL-PFU database.

```{r}
supply_2013 <- matsbyname::sumall_byname(R_supply_2013) + 
  as.numeric(V_supply_2013)
supply_2013
consumption_2013 <- as.numeric(Y_consumption_2013)
consumption_2013
# This difference should be exactly 0, and it is.
supply_2013 - consumption_2013
```


## Compare across years

The data for 2013 have an interesting feature: 
the **U** matrix is empty of Naphtha, because
no Naphtha is used by transformation processes. 
However, in 2014, the energy industry used 1 ktoe of Naphtha.

```{r}
# Row 2 contains data for 2014.
df$U[[2]] %>% 
  matsbyname::select_rows_byname("Naphtha") %>%
  matsbyname::clean_byname()
```

The CL-PFU database contains three **U** matrices
(**U** itself, **U_feed**, and **U_EIOU**) and
a related matrix (**r_EIOU**). 
We can use **U_feed** and **U_EIOU** to learn the purpose
of the 1 ktoe of Naphtha consumption by the energy industry in 2014.

```{r}
df$U_feed[[2]] |> 
  matsbyname::select_rows_byname("Naphtha") |> 
  matsbyname::clean_byname()

df$U_EIOU[[2]] |> 
  matsbyname::select_rows_byname("Naphtha") |> 
  matsbyname::clean_byname()
```

So we see that the use of Naphtha by the energy industry
is self-consumption by Oil refineries.

Incidentally, 
it is always true that **U** = **U_feed** + **U_eiou**.
The **U_feed** and **U_EIOU** matrices 
give the split between feedstocks and Energy industry own use.
The matrix **r_EIOU** gives the element-wise ratio between **U_EIOU** and **U**.


## Conclusion

Through judicious use of functions in `matsbyname` and other packages, 
analysts can isolate a single energy carrier and
follow its Imports, Stock changes, use, production, and
final demand through the CL-PFU database.

Following a single energy carrier through the PFU Database and comparing to raw IEA data can lead to better understanding of how IEA data are mapped into PSUT matrices.
