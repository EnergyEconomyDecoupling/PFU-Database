\arguments{
\item{countries}{A vector of abbreviations for countries whose energy conversion chain is to be analyzed,
such as "c('GHA', 'ZAF')".
Countries named in \code{countries} can also serve as exemplars for
final-to-useful allocations and efficiencies.}

\item{additional_exemplar_countries}{A vector of country abbreviations for which final-to-useful allocations
and efficiencies will be read.
An energy conversion chain will \emph{not} be constructed for these countries.
However, their final-to-useful allocations and efficiencies
may be used as exemplar information for the countries in \code{countries}.
Default is \code{NULL}, indicating no additional exemplars.}

\item{years}{The years to be studied.}

\item{how_far}{A string indicating the last target to include in the plan that is returned.
Default is "all_targets" to indicate all targets of the plan should be returned.}

\item{iea_data_path}{The path to IEA extended energy balance data in .csv format.}

\item{country_concordance_path}{The path to the country concordance Excel file.}

\item{mw_concordance_path}{The path to the muscle work concordance file.}

\item{amw_analysis_data_path}{The path to the animal muscle work data file.}

\item{hmw_analysis_data_path}{The path to the human muscle work data file.}

\item{phi_constants_path}{The path to a phi (exergy-to-energy ratio) Excel file.}

\item{ceda_data_folder}{The path to the CEDA data in text file, .per, format.}

\item{fao_data_path}{The path to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) data.}

\item{ilo_data_path}{The path to International Labor Organization (ILO) data.}

\item{machine_data_path}{The path to the machine data in .xlsx format.}

\item{exemplar_table_path}{The path to an exemplar table.}

\item{fu_analysis_folder}{The path to a folder containing final-to-useful analyses.
Sub-folders named with 3-letter country abbreviations are assumed.}

\item{reports_source_folders}{A string vector containing paths to folders of report sources, usually
\code{.Rnw} or \code{.Rmd} files.}

\item{reports_dest_folder}{The path to a folder into which reports are written.}

\item{pipeline_releases_folder}{The path to a folder where releases of important targets are stored
for later retrieval as pinned items on a pinboard.}

\item{pipeline_caches_folder}{The path to a folder where .zipped versions of the pipeline
cache are stored.}

\item{release}{A boolean that tells whether a new release of the \code{PSUT} targets should be made.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A \code{targets} pipeline.
