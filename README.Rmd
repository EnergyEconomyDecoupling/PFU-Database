# PFUPipeline 


## Statement of need

The CL-PFU database uses many sources of input data
spanning hundreds of data files. 
When creating the CL-PFU database, 
matrices are created according to the 
[PSUT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261918308298?via%3Dihub)
framework, 
final energy data are extended to the useful stage, and 
energy conversion chains are converted to exergy quantifications.
A way to specify all calculation steps is needed.
Furthermore, the calculations take many hours to complete, 
so what is done should stay done
during debugging.
Calculation pipelines are needed, 
ones that clearly identify all steps in database creation
and ones that can be resumed where needed.

This package (`PFUPipeline`) provides functions to create
several products of the CL-PFU database.
The primary objective of `PFUPipeline` is to create data frames
of **RUVY** matrices in [matsindf](https://MatthewHeun.github.io/matsindf/) format.
A [targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) pipeline
provides helpful dependency management for the calculations.


## Quick start

At the RStudio console, type

``` r
library(targets)              # to load the targets package   
tar_visnetwork()              # to see a directed acyclic graph of the calculations that will take place   
tar_make_future(workers = 2)  # to execute the calculations (or `workers = 8`, if you have enough cores)
```


## Accessing targets

A list of targets can be found with `PFUPipeline::target_names`.
A list of target meanings can be found with `?PFUPipeline::target_names`.

`targets::tar_read(<<target>>)` pulls the value of a target out of the `targets` cache. 
(`<<target>>` should be an unquoted symbol such as `Specified`.)


## Fresh start

`targets::tar_destroy()` invalidates the `targets` cache and forces reanalysis of everything.
Reanalyzing everything may take a while.


## More Information

For information about the `targets` package, 
see the [targets manual](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/).

For documentation on the `PFUPipeline` package, 
see <https://EnergyEconomyDecoupling.github.io/PFUPipeline/>.


## History

The CL-PFU database is supported by an EPSRC
[fellowship](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/energy-climate-change-mitigation/dir-record/research-projects/1773/epsrc-fellowship-applying-thermodynamic-laws-to-the-energy-gdp-decoupling-problem)
awarded to Paul Brockway of Leeds University.
A goal of the fellowship is building
a world database of country-specific primary, final, and useful exergy 
for 1960--2019.
