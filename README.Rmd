# PFUDatabase [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5228375.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5228375)

This repository contains analysis code for the fellowship project of Paul Brockway.
One goal of the fellowship is building a world database of country-specific primary, final, and useful exergy 
for 1960--2019.

Analyses are completed using the [targets](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) environment
which provides helpful dependency management for the calculation pipeline. 

This repository also includes a ShinyApp for visualization of the data analyzed in the targets workflow.


## Quick start

At the RStudio console, type

``` r
library(targets)              # to load the targets package   
tar_visnetwork()              # to see a directed acyclic graph of the calculations that will take place   
tar_make_future(workers = 2)  # to execute the calculations (or `workers = 8`, if you have enough cores)
```

To run the App simply open the App.R script in the ShinyApp file and click RunApp.


### Accessing targets

A list of targets can be found with `PFUDatabase::target_names`.
A list of target meanings can be found with `?PFUDatabase::target_names`.

`targets::tar_read(<<target>>)` pulls the value of a target out of the `targets` cache. 
(`<<target>>` should be an unquoted symbol such as `Specified`.)


### Fresh start

`targets::tar_destroy()` invalidates the `targets` cache and forces reanalysis of everything.
Reanalyzing everything may take a while.


### More Information

For information about the `targets` package, 
see the [targets manual](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/).
