# PFU-Database

This repository contains analysis code for the fellowship project for Paul Brockway.
One goal of the fellowship is building a world database of country-specific primary, final, and useful exergy 
for 1960--2015.

Analyses are completed using the [drake](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) environment
which provides helpful dependency management. 
See the [drake manual](https://books.ropensci.org/drake/) for details.


## Quick start

At the RStudio console, type

`library(drake)`  
`r_make()`


## Advanced

Consider setting RStudio keyboard shortcuts for executing the drake plan in this repository.
See `Tools|Modify keyboard shortcuts...`.
Some convenient keyboard shortcuts are:

* `command-option-control-D` (for *d*rake) to execute the "Run a drake workflow" command on the `plan`
* `command-option-control-V` (for *v*isualize) to execute "Visualize a drake workflow" command on the `plan`

With those keyboard shortcuts in place, the 

`library(drake)`  

command needs to be issued only *once* after first opening the project in RStudio.  

Thereafter, type the keyboard shortcut `command-option-control-D`
(instead of `r_make()`) to re-run the analysis.
Type the keyboard shortcut `command-option-control-V`
(instead of `vis_drake_graph(plan)`) 
to visualize the dependency tree as a directed acyclic graph.
The command `sankey_drake_graph(plan)` will produce a Sankey diagram
of the dependency tree.
