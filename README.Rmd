# PFU-Database

This repository contains analysis code for the fellowship project for Paul Brockway.
One goal of the fellowship is building a world database of country-specific primary, final, and useful exergy 
for 1960--2015.

Analyses are completed using the [drake](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) environment
which provides helpful dependency management. 


## Quick start

At the RStudio console, type

``` r
library(drake)           # to load the drake package   
source("_drake.R")       # to load the plan object
r_vis_drake_graph()      # to see a directed acyclic graph of the calculations that will take place   
r_make()                 # to execute the calculations
```

## Advanced

### Keyboard shortcuts

Consider setting RStudio keyboard shortcuts for executing the drake plan in this repository.
See `Tools|Modify keyboard shortcuts...`.
Some convenient keyboard shortcuts are:

* `command-option-control-V` (for *v*isualize) to execute the "Visualize a drake workflow" command on the `plan`
* `command-option-control-D` (for *d*rake) to execute the "Run a drake workflow" command on the `plan`

Type the keyboard shortcut `command-option-control-V`
(instead of `r_vis_drake_graph(plan)`) 
to visualize the dependency tree as a directed acyclic graph.
Type the keyboard shortcut `command-option-control-D`
(instead of `r_make()`) to re-run the analysis.


### Accessing targets

A list of targets can be found with `SEAPSUTWorkflow::target_names`.
A list of target meanings can be found with `?SEAPSUTWorkflow::target_names`.

`drake::readd(<<target>>)` pulls the value of a target out of `drake`'s cache. 
`<<target>>` should be a quoted character string such as "Specified".

`drake::loadd(<<target>>)` copies the value of a target out of `drake`'s cache into the environment.

`SEAPSUTWorkflow::readd_by_country(<<target>>, <<country>>)` reads country-specific data out of the `drake` cache.
Both `<<target>>` and `<<country>>` should be quoted strings.
`<<country>>` should be a 3-letter ISO abbreviation such as "ESP" or "ZAF".
See `?SEAPSUTWorkflow::readd_by_country` for more details.


### Fresh start

`drake::clean()` invalidates `drake`'s cache and forces reanalysis of everything.
Reanalyzing everything may take a while.
